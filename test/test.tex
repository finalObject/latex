\ldots and here it ends.\\
\ldots when Einstein introduced his formula
\begin{equation}
  e = m \cdot c^{2xx} \; ,
\end{equation}
which is at the same time the most widely known
and the least well understood physical formula.\\
% Example 2
\ldots from which follows Kirchoff’s current law:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^{n} I_k = 0 \; .
\end{equation}

Kirchhoff’s voltage law can be derived \ldots\\
% Example 3
\ldots which has several advantages.

\begin{equation}
I_{D} = I_F - I_R
\end{equation}
is the core of a very different transistor model. \ldots
